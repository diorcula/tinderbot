tinderbot 4 fun, no time 4 dating 2020 vision
Project was made after watching the video from Code Dripp, which tutorial i followed as well:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvFAuUcowT4&t=98s
- https://github.com/aj-4/tinder-swipe-bot/blob/master/tinder_bot.py


This is an automated tinder swiper bot.
Important:
- change the credentials in the secrets.py file in the tinderbotfolder to match your Facebook account.
- [New folder] contains the chromedriver used in the project, this location needs to be included in the PATH in envrionment variables.
- in the code itself, the "like"probability is set to 65%, meaning that for every profile there is a chance of 65% that the bot will swipe right. Otherwise it will swipe left with a chance of the remaining 35%. KWIK MAFFS.

N.B.
- a free tinder account only has about 100 swipes every 12 hours or so, so use them wise whilst testing.

- i hope to update this project in the future to where you can include some pictures of people and then the bot will swipe based on similar images.


P.S.
- i do not approve of abuse of this, i simply thought it was a handy tool to test some Python things with.
- furthermore, do not expect this to rank up your matches, for a match to occur the other party has to like you as well. I cannot make you more attractive.
